# 🎓 Predictive Analytics for At-Risk Students

## 📌 Problem Statement
In many colleges and universities, students often face challenges such as **low attendance, poor academic performance, or financial issues** that put them at risk of failing or dropping out.  
However, early identification of these at-risk students is difficult, leading to delayed interventions from faculty or administration.

## ✅ Our Solution
This project uses **Predictive Analytics** to **identify students at risk early** based on multiple factors such as:
- Attendance records 📊
- Academic performance (CGPA, backlogs) 📉
- Financial issues 💰

The system provides insights that can help:
- Faculty take corrective actions (extra classes, mentoring)  
- Administration optimize resources & support  
- Students receive timely intervention to improve performance

## 🛠️ Technology & Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries/Packages:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **Data Handling:** Student academic & attendance dataset (sample data created for testing)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

---

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Data of students (attendance, CGPA, backlogs, fees status) is collected.  
2. Preprocessing is done using **Pandas & NumPy**.  
3. Predictive models/logic are applied to classify students as **Safe, At Risk, or Critical**.  
4. Results are displayed for faculty/admin to take decisions.
